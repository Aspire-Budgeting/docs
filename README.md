# Welcome

**Welcome to Aspire!** Aspire is an envelope-style budgeting spreadsheet. Its primary goal is to give you the power and ability to be proactive with your finances - all in a delightfully designed Google Sheet. With Aspire, you can see your budget with just a glance, quickly add transactions as you make them, and run reports to gain new insights on your spending.

Aspire is full of features to help you budget your finances. These docs will help you understand the basics of budgeting and explain how to use Aspire.

Take a look at the [Getting Started](/getting-started) page for information on setting up your Aspire sheet.
