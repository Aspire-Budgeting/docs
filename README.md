# Aspire Budgeting - platform-docs

### Getting Started

To set up the `platform-docs` project, clone this repository to your local computer, navigate to the `platform-docs` directory and run `npm install`. This will pull down all the necessary packages to build and generate the documentation locally on your computer.

Once all the packages have installed, you can run `npm run dev` and this will build the documentation and start up a local server for you to test the docs in your browser.
