If this happens, don't fret! Aspire has a built in mechanism to help you work through this situation. If you overpay your credit card and your credit card account turns positive, you'll need to enter what's called an ðŸ”„ `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Overpayment Correction`}</strong>{` transaction. To do this, simply add an Inflow transaction for the amount you overpaid your card, select `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Available to budget`}</strong>{` as the Category, and ðŸ”„ `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Overpayment Correction`}</strong>{` as the Account. You only need to add an ðŸ”„ `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Overpayment Correction`}</strong>{` if the associated credit card account turned positive. If the credit card account is still negative, then you simply need to cover this negative balance by moving funds from another category to cover the overpayment.`}</p>\n    <p>{`When using ðŸ”„ `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Overpayment Correction`}</strong>{`, you'll notice that same amount get added to `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Available to budget`}</strong>{`. You can take these funds and apply them to any category. In this particular case, you don't need to worry about adjusting your credit card's category balance as typical monthly usage will cause the negative category balance and positive account balance to resolve itself.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To explain the why behind this, remember that every dollar in your possession should be assigned a job. When you paid your credit card, not all of your dollars were needed for that job (because it was overpaid) - this means they need a new job!`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
