# Overview

**Welcome to Build@Aspire!** Aspire is a powerful budgeting spreadsheet built on the foundation of Google Sheets. Aspire has thousands of users and serves the broad market of users all over the world who want a simple and full-featured budgeting tool. Even though Aspire has many built in features and functions, there are countless opportunities to extend these basic features with custom views and extensions. Build@Aspire is the official program through which Aspire can be extended and posted for the community at large to consume.

## How can I extend Aspire?

Extending Aspire is easy. Here in the docs is an [entire section](api-named-ranges.md) dedicated to the various ways in which you can reference Aspire's data. These references are called Named Ranges. They allow a value or range to be accessed without the consumer of the value\(s\) needing to worry about which exact cell\(s\) the data is stored in. This is useful because as Aspire grows and changes, cells and locations of data may be relocated in the Aspire spreadsheet. Having these references \(Named Ranges\) removes the builder's concern of needing to update code and formulas with any new/changed cell references. This allows you as the build to be totally focused on building great extensions, apps, and spreadsheets.
