# Submission Guidelines

## Steps for submission

To be listed in the Build@Aspire repository, you will need to follow the guidelines below when creating your extension. When you are ready to have your extension reviewed, [create an issue here](https://github.com/Aspire-Budgeting/build-at-aspire/issues) and I'll review the details of your submission and extension. Once everything is in order, I'll add your details to the official Build@Aspire repository and your extension will be listed on the offical Aspire Budgeting website. This might sound intimidating but it's not - I promise I'm friendly ðŸ˜ƒ.

These guidelines are pretty minimal, but they exist to ensure the best possible user experience  for users of Aspire and of tools from the Build@Aspire repository.
